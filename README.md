# HTML-CSS
Here is a compilation of projects created using HTML&CSS.

"Portfolio Website" is my first ever website created using HTML&CSS along with Bootstrap 3. Important things I learned are the grid system for Bootstrap 3, absolute vs relative positioning in CSS, the basic website layout for HTML and much more.
An online version of this website can also be found at http://atokoomson.000webhostapp.com/.
